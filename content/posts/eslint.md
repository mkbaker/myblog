# The Error: ESLint fails to work at all

How annoying. Why are you gonna yell at me and then not do anything about it? I tried reinstalling, restarting, even completely removing VSCode and reinstalling it. I would get the same error: ESLint cannot work, consider opening a bug ticket. 

# The Fix

Run "eslint --init" in the root of the project. It'll ask a bunch of questions, but then it works! Amazing.
