Turns out, it's not a "bin" where random files get tossed. 

The name "/bin" is short for **binary**. 

> Often, the word "binary" is used to refer to executable programs or other files that contains non-readable characters. The /bin directory is where many of the system-related binaries are kept, hence the name. Although several of the files in this directory are used for administrative purposes and cannot be run by normal users, everyone has read permission on this directory, so you can at least see what the directory contains.
